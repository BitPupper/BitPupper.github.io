title: "What I Understood Of Quantum Zero Knowledge Proofs With My 2 Braincells"

I was intrigued by the counter intuitive term "zero knowledge proofs"... what does it mean? Proofs with no starting information? Proofs that don't prove anything? Or something else? I attempt to explain everything to past me to the best of my abilities.
It is unfortunate that most of the work on ZKPs are for cryptocurrency, a topic I am not very interested in, and a controvertial topic too at times. But I think there were some very neat concepts in there which I wanted to do justice.
